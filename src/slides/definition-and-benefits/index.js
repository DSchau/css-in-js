Early on in my career, I was in a meeting where I said that a solution/idea wasn't good and left it at that. Another person in the meeting said something to the effect of "If you can't bring anything to the table, then don't say anything at all." Obviously I don't agree with his sentiment, but that doesn't detract from the fact that he wasn't wrong. So now that we've illustrated some of the problems of CSS, the discussion will shift into what CSS in JS is, and how it can fix some of these aforementioned problems aka I'm trying to bring something to the table :).

- I want to be *very* clear here, if you haven't seen yourself running into any of the aforementioned problems, and if you leave here unconvinced, that's fine!
- CSS as it exists will continue to exist
- It's not CSS in JS or CSS. CSS in JS uses CSS and uses what I think are the best parts of CSS (aka the rules) and avoids the worst parts (aka the nesting, globals, etc.)
