I think it's important to actually show some real-world usage and common patterns for writing "real world" code in each of these libraries.

Common things like theming, utilizing props, inheriting/composing styles, etc.

_Note: I'm not endorsing any particular library, so I'll jump around a bit to give you a better idea of what each library feels like._

  </div>;

UsingProps.Props = {
  bgColor: 'code',
  notes: `
Props injection is a natural, React-y method of altering a given component's style under certain conditions. For instance, if re-visit our earlier CSS only button, we can create the same with props, but with complete encapsulation to that single button component.
  `

      Inheritance

  </div>;

Inheritance.Props = {
  bgColor: 'code',
  notes: `
A common question is that one of CSS' great features is inheritance and easy extension of base classes. Inheritance is typically accomplished in these libraries by injecting a previously styled component (ðŸ˜‰) and adding additional styles.

RealCSS.Props = {
  bgColor: 'code',
  notes: `
One final reminder that in each of these libraries, real CSS and real stylesheets are added to the DOM. The value of CSS remains but with the clear and numerous benefits that CSS in JS provides.

  </div>;

Animation.Props = {
  bgColor: 'code',
  notes: `
But what about animations? Those are inherently global!

Most libraries include some type of helper utility to return a unique identifier/hash for those animations so that globals remain stripped from the code base.

UsingClassName.Props = {
  bgColor: 'code',
  notes: `
If you're designing a component library and want to make it CSS in JS friendly, consider exposing the className prop for consumption

- these libraries inject a className (and a \`style\` tag in the DOM), which would then be applied on top of the existing styles
- Additionally, if you are "wrapping" your styled elements, this is a great way to make those wrappers extensible, as well

ExternalLibraries.Props = {
  bgColor: 'code',
  notes: `
Libraries that require a certain class structure (e.g. Bootstrap), can also work with CSS in JS libraries!

This example exposes a wrapped bootstrap Alert, which can then be used as a regular React component
