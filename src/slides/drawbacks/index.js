When JavaScript is disabled (still can be a concern!), how do we progressively enhance? If JavaScript is our styling and rendering solution, we're serving effectively an unstyled mess of content, which goes directly contrary to the ideas of progressive enhancement.

0.2% of users may not seem like much, but if you're Facebook scale or driving a lot of traffic it's a concern

- 1,000,000 monthly users means 2,000 users may not be getting a usable site

How can we fix this?

You can mitigate with server side rendering (something like next would be terrific) or statically rendering to HTML (with something like Gatsby)

Rich Harris, creator of such tools as Rollup, Buble, Svelte, etc. raises an interesting point. Not only are the styles not scrapeable, but the styles can be hard to query, as well. Things like e2e tests or integration tests should not be pointed to a unique hash, and so it's certainly a best practice to either use one of the existing babel plugins for most libraries that adds a humanized class name, or manually add your own!

  notes: `
Performance can be a concern, but I'd urge you here to not prematurely optimize. The difference between each of the libraries is arguably minimal, and the difference between CSS is relatively minimal as well.

However, if you're pushing Facebook-scaleâ„¢, or after measuring your application's performance, then it may be worth re-visiting whether these libraries are for you, or whether there are performance optimizations you can make to improve perf.
