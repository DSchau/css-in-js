Let's start with a brief discussion of some of the problems of CSS. An important caveat here, these problems tend to be focused on real-world examples that every-day developers have run into, or have run into without even realizing it and resorting to hack-y work arounds. This is not to say that problems "at scale" are not important, but if we can narrow the scope to problems that every-day developers, and myself, have faced, we can more clearly define the problems in more approachable terms and concepts. In illustrating these real-world problems, the foundational basis for the creation of these CSS in JS techniques will be made evident.

Our first task from the UX team to design a button component that has a hover state and raises slightly on hover. We design and build this with vanilla CSS and HTML. This button looks great, meets every current need we have, and the code is quite succinct, to boot. This is a _great_ component!

Check out the [code slide here](https://css-in-js.dustinschau.com/#/the-globals)

Our clean, pristine button component and CSS are no longer so clean. Each of these simple requests stack and increase the complexity of the component.

In effect, we've introduced a number of CSS globals. As anyone is aware, globals are a common enemy of any codebase, and the introduction of globals will make this CSS harder to maintain, use, and develop against. This is especially evident if designing something like a component library, where hundreds of other developers in our company will use this button, extend upon it, and introduce their own globals. It's incredibly easy to imagine a scenario where collision occurs and this practice makes this approach untenable.

  Let's consider the usage of this button component by a developer who comes on the project long down the road, far after the team that designed the component has left for greener pastures. This developer is relatively inexperienced, and is just trying to add in style that makes a link look like a button. This seemingly simple task is more complicated than it appears at first glance. These globals make the job _far_ more diffiult than expected, and the developer resorts to messy hacks and the use of \`!important\` in an effort to ship and meet a deadline.

But others still will note that this problem of globals has been solved with tooling in other areas. CSS Modules and Shadow DOM (a staged spec introduced in web components to isolate styling to a particular subset of the DOM) _both_ are intended to solve this problem.

CSS Modules is an implementation of CSS in JS, so if you leave here with nothing else, consider integrating CSS Modules support into your application. It'll generate a unique hash based on a user supplied class name. Shadow modules are similarly going to be great, but I'm not quite sure they're ready for primetime yet (nor are web components _quite_ there in my opinion).

The bigger your application gets (and the more CSS you write), the more globals you will create which is quite simply making your application harder to maintain and use. In order to work around these scaling issues, naming strategies or tools--LESS, SASS, etc.--are often utilized.

CSS in JS solves this problems cleanly, clearly, and simply.

Also I'd like to note here that, in general, I tend to think "does not scale," is a perjorative used by people who are just not fans of that particular technology. That is not the case here though, as most advocates of CSS in JS _love_ CSS. You'll also see soon that when you're writing CSS in JS, you're using all the functionality that we know and love in CSS.

Your class names and styles (i.e. \`.css\` files) are separately located to what is being styled, typically JSX with \`className\` or in non-React projects, as separate HTML files. Additionally, as previously mentioned, as CSS is global by default, your styles could be styling unrelated functionality in your application. Jointly, these two concerns make it incredibly difficult to re-factor unused CSS.

Removing styles can be a spooky endeavour ðŸ‘», and many regression tests, QA, or manual testing is often required to validate with certainty that only certain functionality was impacted. Each of these techniques requires manual testing and validation, and is not something that every developer has available to them.

CSS in JS gives you confidence that by removing this particular component, you're removing style code applicable to this component _only_.
