My name is Dustin Schau, and I'm going to hopefully teach you all about CSS in JS today. We'll start with some drawbacks of CSS that led to the creation of these libraries, then discuss advantages of CSS in JS over CSS, shift to discussion of some common patterns, utilities, and libraries to instrument CSS in JS, and then finally end with an illustration of the drawbacks of CSS in JS. Let's get started!

I'm a frontend developer speciailizing in all things JavaScript. Throughout my career, I've done a fair bit of everything: Angular, React, jQuery, you name it. Of course, I've also done a fair bit of everything in CSS land, whether it's vanilla CSS, LESS, SASS, CSS Modules, and (of course) the gamut of CSS in JS solutions. I'm from little ol' Omaha, Nebraska, which I think most people looks a bit like this.

I feel like some of you _may_ have a pretty negative perception of CSS in JS, or at least not an overtly positive perception. This can be for a variety of reasons, but I thik paramount in some people's minds is that it goes against the "separation of concerns" that have been ingrained in our minds and regularly re-enforced. It can feel weird, it can feel unclean, and it may even feel like a solution looking for a problem.

## Agenda

- Discussion of the problems of CSS
- Defining what CSS in JS is, and how it can solve some of these problems
- Discussing some various CSS in JS libraries, any real world examples of usage of these
- Finishing up with some discussion of drawbacks of CSS in JS and some quick demos
